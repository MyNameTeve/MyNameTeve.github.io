## Hello!

I've owned a website for a while, but I haven't really been _maintaining_ it much. After buying some domain names and realizing that my current hosting solution (AWS s3 static site + R53 domain) wasn't going to allow me to cheaply set up an SSL cert, I decided to switch to using Namecheap + github.io. 

This, of course, led to an entire yak shaving affair when I asked myself "so what if I used Gatsby..."

And here we are. I'll be doing some fun stuff here, hopefully... consistently (tbh my biggest weakness).
